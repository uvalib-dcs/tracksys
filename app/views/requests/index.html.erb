  <p><span class="important">Notice: Warning Concerning Copyright</span> &#8212; The copyright
    law of the United States (Title 17, United States Code) governs
    the making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted material. Under
    certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives are authorized
    to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction. One of these specified conditions
    is that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be &#8220;used for any purpose
    other than private study, scholarship, or research.&#8221; If a user makes a
    request for, or later uses a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess
    of &#8220;fair use,&#8221; that user may be liable for copyright infringement. The Library&#8217;s
    provision of a copy does not constitute permission by any copyright holder
    and is not a substitute for the user&#8217;s diligent compliance with all
    applicable copyright requirements. This institution reserves the
    right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its judgment, fulfillment
    of the order would involve violation of the copyright law. </p>
