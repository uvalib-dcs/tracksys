===============================================================================

1. In TrackSys an item is flagged with a date_dl_ingest or date_dl_update
   to indicate publication or update to the DL.
2. Overnight, backend scripts (not part of TrackSys) are run that harvest the 
   flagged items and publish them to DL.
3. First, /api/published is called. This returns a CSV list of catalog
   keys that have been published to the DL.
4. Next, /api/solr?timestamp=[TS]&5sirsi=1 is called. This gets a list of
   catalog keys for SirsiMetadata items that have been flagged for publicagtion
   since the timestamp.
5. For each catalog key in the changed list, /api/sirsi/[catalog_key] is 
   called. This returns a block of JSON containing params needed by the
   backend process to generate the Solr index records for the item.
6. At this point, all SirsiMetadata items have been ingested, and focus
   switches to XML. Get a CSV of PIDs for changed XmlMetadata items 
   with a call to: /api/solr?timestamp=[TS]
7. For each item returned above, /api/solr/[PID] is called to generate
   the solr index for the item. This uses the holsinger transform. This
   call also hittings a few other API endpoints to do the work:
      a) /api/stylesheet/holsinger : get the XSL transform
      b) /api/metadata/[PID]?type=desc_metadata : get the XML Metadata
      c) The actual transform is done with a SaxonServlet call:
         http://transform.lib.virginia.edu:8084/saxon/SaxonServlet
